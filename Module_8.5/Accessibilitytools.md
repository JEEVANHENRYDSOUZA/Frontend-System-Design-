## Accessibility tools
### There are 3 types 
- Automation Accessibillty Tools: Automation accessibility tools are software applications or browser extensions that help developers test and improve the accessibility of their web applications automatically. These tools analyze web pages and identify accessibility issues, providing developers with actionable feedback to address them. Here are some popular automation accessibility tools:

1. **axe DevTools (axe Chrome Extension and axe Firefox Extension)**:
   - axe DevTools is a browser extension available for Chrome and Firefox that integrates into the browser's developer tools.
   - It allows developers to run automated accessibility tests directly within the browser and identify accessibility issues in real-time.
   - The extension provides detailed reports with recommendations for fixing accessibility violations.

2. **Accessibility Insights**:
   - Accessibility Insights is a suite of accessibility testing tools provided by Microsoft.
   - It includes browser extensions for Chrome and Edge, as well as a desktop application.
   - Accessibility Insights offers automated accessibility scans, as well as manual testing features for developers and testers.

3. **Lighthouse**:
   - Lighthouse is an open-source automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.
   - It is built into Google Chrome's developer tools and provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.
   - The accessibility audit in Lighthouse checks for common accessibility issues and provides suggestions for improvement.

4. **Pa11y**:
   - Pa11y is an open-source accessibility testing tool that can be used via the command line, as a web service, or integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
   - It supports automated testing of single web pages or entire websites and provides detailed reports with accessibility issues.

5. **Deque Axe CLI**:
   - Deque Axe CLI is a command-line tool that uses the axe-core accessibility engine to test web pages for accessibility issues.
   - It can be integrated into automated testing workflows and provides JSON or CSV reports with accessibility findings.

6. **Tenon.io**:
   - Tenon.io is a cloud-based accessibility testing service that offers automated testing of web pages for accessibility issues.
   - It provides detailed reports with prioritized issues and recommendations for fixing accessibility problems.


- Manual Accessibility : Manual accessibility tools are software applications or resources that assist developers and testers in manually assessing and improving the accessibility of web content. Unlike automated accessibility tools that primarily focus on automated scans and checks, manual accessibility tools require human intervention to evaluate various aspects of accessibility and ensure compliance with accessibility standards and guidelines. Here are some common examples of manual accessibility tools:

1. **Screen Readers**:
   - Screen readers such as NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), JAWS (Job Access With Speech), and VoiceOver (built into macOS and iOS) simulate the experience of users with visual impairments by converting on-screen content into speech or Braille output.
   - Developers and testers can use screen readers to navigate web pages, test keyboard accessibility, and verify the accessibility of elements such as links, buttons, form controls, and images.

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Manual keyboard navigation involves using the keyboard exclusively to navigate and interact with web content, without relying on a mouse or touch input.
   - Developers can test keyboard accessibility by tabbing through interactive elements, triggering actions, and verifying the logical sequence of focusable elements.

3. **Color Contrast Checkers**:
   - Color contrast checkers help assess the contrast between text and background colors, ensuring that text is readable for users with low vision or color blindness.
   - Developers can manually input color values or use browser extensions to inspect color contrast ratios and identify potential issues.

4. **Accessibility Testing Checklists and Guidelines**:
   - Various accessibility testing checklists and guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), provide comprehensive lists of accessibility considerations and best practices.
   - Developers and testers can refer to these resources to manually evaluate web content for adherence to accessibility principles and guidelines.

5. **Manual Code Reviews**:
   - Manual code reviews involve inspecting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of web pages to identify accessibility issues that may not be caught by automated tools.
   - Developers can review code for proper semantic structure, use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, keyboard accessibility, and other accessibility-related considerations.

6. **User Testing with People with Disabilities**:
   - User testing involving individuals with disabilities provides valuable insights into the accessibility and usability of web content from the perspective of real users.
   - Developers can conduct user testing sessions, gather feedback, and observe how users interact with the website using assistive technologies.
