## Server Side Request Forgery 
- We have the website server which is publicly avaialble
- This server has acess to the internal private network architecture
- This if we can access the server then the internal network can be accessed this is called server side request forgery 

## Mitigation 
- Input Validation 
- Whitelisting server --- Making known which server can access data and which cannot 
- Insufficient access control
- XML external entity attack ---XXE
