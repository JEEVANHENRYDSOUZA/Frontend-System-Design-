## Short Polling 
### Working 
- Request to the server is sent then we receive a response and then the communication ends
- Again after an interval of time request is made to the server 
### Drawback 
- Short Lived Connection 
- No persistant connectivity 
- Less resource utilization 
- Problem with scale 
### Example
- It is not exactly real time but can be use for real time
- Cricinfo
- Analytics
