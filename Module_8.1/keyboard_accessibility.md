## Web Accesibility 
### What is Web Accesisbility
- Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that ensures equal access and usability for people with disabilities. 
- This includes individuals with various disabilities such as visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.

### Disabilites tha we need to  make sure are able to use our website are 
- Hearing
- Vision 
- Motor
- Neruological 
- Situiational 
- Speech 
- Temporary Disability --- due to a surgery 

### WCAG Standard - Web Content Accesibility Guideline
1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive. This includes providing alternatives for non-text content such as images, videos, and audio, ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors, and making sure content can be presented in different ways without losing meaning.

2. **Operable**: Users should be able to operate the interface and navigate through content using different input methods such as keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice commands. This involves ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard, providing enough time for users to interact with content, and avoiding content that may cause seizures or physical reactions.

3. **Understandable**: Content and navigation should be clear and easy to understand. This includes using clear and consistent language, organizing content in a logical manner, providing helpful error messages, and ensuring users can easily navigate and find the information they need.

4. **Robust**: Websites and web applications should be compatible with a wide range of assistive technologies and devices, including screen readers, magnifiers, speech recognition software, and alternative input devices. This involves using semantic HTML, providing proper labeling for interactive elements, and ensuring compatibility with accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).



### WCAG Levels: 
1. **Level A (Minimum Level)**:
   - Level A includes the most basic accessibility features, which address the most common barriers for individuals with disabilities.
   - Meeting Level A criteria is essential for ensuring some level of accessibility for all users.
   - Examples of Level A criteria include providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring keyboard accessibility for all functionality, and ensuring content is readable and understandable.

2. **Level AA (Standard Level)**:
   - Level AA builds upon Level A criteria and includes additional requirements that enhance accessibility and usability for a wider range of individuals with disabilities.
   - Meeting Level AA criteria significantly improves accessibility and usability for most users.
   - Examples of Level AA criteria include providing captions for prerecorded audio content, ensuring sufficient color contrast for text and images, and making content more navigable and understandable.

3. **Level AAA (Enhanced Level)**:
   - Level AAA includes the highest level of accessibility criteria, providing the most comprehensive level of accessibility support.
   - Meeting Level AAA criteria requires significant effort and may not be feasible for all content or situations.
   - Examples of Level AAA criteria include providing sign language interpretation for all audio content, ensuring content can be navigated and operated using a wide range of input methods, and minimizing distractions and interruptions.
