## WebRTC
The WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) process involves several steps to establish real-time audio, video, and data communication between web browsers. Here's an overview of the typical WebRTC process:

1. **Discovery and Negotiation**:
   - **Offerer and Answerer**: The process starts with two peers, often referred to as the "offerer" and the "answerer," who want to establish a communication session.
   - **Session Description**: The offerer creates an initial session description, which includes details about the media streams (audio, video) it wants to share and network configurations.
   - **ICE Candidates**: Each peer gathers ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates, which are potential network addresses and transport information used for communication.

2. **Signaling**:
   - **Exchange Session Descriptions**: The offerer sends its session description to the answerer using a signaling mechanism. This can involve protocols like WebSocket, HTTP, or a custom signaling server.
   - **Exchange ICE Candidates**: The peers exchange ICE candidates through the signaling channel. This allows them to discover and exchange network information necessary to establish a direct connection.

3. **ICE Connectivity Checks**:
   - **ICE Agent**: Each peer's ICE agent performs connectivity checks using the exchanged ICE candidates. It tries various network paths to determine the best communication route.
   - **STUN and TURN Servers**: If direct peer-to-peer communication is not possible due to NAT traversal issues, peers may use STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers to assist in establishing connections.

4. **Establishing Peer Connection**:
   - **ICE Connection Establishment**: Once suitable candidates are selected and connectivity checks succeed, the peers establish a direct peer-to-peer connection using the chosen candidates.
   - **DTLS Handshake**: The peers perform a DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) handshake to encrypt and secure the communication channel.

5. **Media Exchange**:
   - **Media Stream Setup**: Once the peer connection is established, the peers begin exchanging media streams (audio, video) using Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP).
   - **Data Channel Setup**: Optionally, peers can establish a bidirectional data channel using the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) protocol for sending non-media data, such as text messages or application data.

6. **Communication**:
   - **Real-Time Interaction**: With the peer connection established and media streams exchanged, the peers can engage in real-time communication, such as video calls, voice calls, or data exchange, directly within their web browsers.

7. **Closing the Connection**:
   - **Session Termination**: When the communication session is complete, the peers close the peer connection, release network resources, and terminate the media streams.
